0x0B. C - malloc, free
I will be writing the following function in order to get a better understanding of how to dynamically allocate memory. 

There are 7 tasks in total 

Task 0 which asks to "Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char." focuses on memory allocation using malloc and demonstrates how to return and use dynamically allocated memory effectively. The task demonstrates how to use the malloc function to allocate memory for an array of characters at runtime. This is important for situations where the array size is not known at compile time. Additionally it allows me to get use to working with pointers to dynamically allocate memory.

Task 1 which asks to "Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter." focuses on the concept of dynamically allocating memory using malloc to create a new string that's a duplicate of an input strings. 

Task 2 which asks to "Write a function that concatenates two strings." focuses on how to combine two strings into a single string. This is a common operation when working with strings.

Task 3 which asks to "Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers."focuses on how to allocate memory for a 2D array dynamically using malloc.

Task 4 which asks to "Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function." seeks to test your ability to properly free memory that was dynamically allocated for a 2D array using malloc

Task 5 which asks to "Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program." teaches how to work with command line arguments passed to a program and manipulate them using pointers and string functions.

and lastly 

Task 6 which asks to "Write a function that splits a string into words." seeks to teach students learn how to manipulate strings to extract words based on certain delimiters, in this case, spaces.

All in all these tasks aim to provide learners with practical experience and understanding of important concepts in programming, particularly in the context of memory management and manipulation of strings and arrays.
